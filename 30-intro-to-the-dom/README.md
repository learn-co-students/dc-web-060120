# Intro to the DOM ðŸ“œ

## Three things that JS allows us to do:

1. Interact with the web page (DOM) *<= this lecture*
2. Account for user interaction
3. Run requests

## SWBATs

- [ ] Draw DOM tree by looking at HTML
- [ ] Explain what a DOM node is and what its most important attributes are
- [ ] Use the Chrome Dev tools to explore the DOM tree and its attributes
- [ ] Use JS to select DOM nodes
- [ ] Use JS to add, remove, and edit DOM nodes

### The Document Object Model Overview
> The DOM is the browser's programmatic representation of the web page (the HTML). This means we can manipulate the DOM using JavaScript to change what we see on the web page.

- What is the DOM?
  - The DOM (Document Object Model) is a representation of an HTML document as a **tree** (more on this later) that can be manipulated with JavaScript
  - Javascript is a language created to manipulate the DOM
  - "[JavaScript] DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them you can change the document's structure, style or content." - [MDN DOM Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) (more on this later)

## The DOM is a Tree ðŸŽ„

- What is a tree in computer science? A data structure that represents some hierarchical structure; parent nodes (elements), child nodes, sibling nodes. Trees look like upside down trees:

- Here is another representation of a tree with a root node and several children or branches:

- Here is a representation of our HTML as a tree. This is the DOM:

- DOM (Document Object Model)
  - The DOM is a tree structure with several child `nodes`. All of the elements in the tree are related to each other. Some elements may have children:

```html
<body>
  <div >
    <h1>Welcome to the DOM Dominion</h1>
    <p>A magical land of trees and <em>mystical</em> properties</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Explore the trees</li>
      <li>Discover mystical properties</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</body>
```

---

- This tree structure starts at the `document`, where `document` is the topmost **parent** of each individual `node` (HTML Element). Every single HTML element in the DOM is a `node`: `<p></p>`, `<h1></h1>`, `<img>`, etc. **If you are not comfortable with HTML syntax and/or HTML tags, go through the [intro to HTML section on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)**
- JavaScript allows us to **traverse** this tree to find and _manipulate_ different `nodes` (we'll see how in a bit).
  - "The DOM model represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node
    contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them you can change the document's
    structure, style or content." -
    [MDN Article on the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)
- Elements (`nodes`) have properties that can be manipulated (`style`, `textContent`, `innerHTML`, etc). In this particular example, we'll be manipulating the `.src` attribute of some `img` tags.
- Element interfaces
  - Different elements (`table`, `p`, `image`) support different methods
    - `image.src`, for instance
    - `document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'red'`
  - Refer to the documentation for each element you wish to manipulate to find out which properties/attributes you can manipulate. - [MDN HTML Element Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

### DOM CRUD

#### READ:

- `document.getElementById`
  - get the `div` with the id `movie-container`

  - searches the document and will return the first (should be only) thing with the matching id

```javascript
let container = document.getElementById("movie-container")
```

- `element.getElementsByTagName`
  - get all the `li` element

  - returns a collection of the items that match the tag name provided

```javascript
let list = document.getElementById("movie-list")
list.getElementsByTagName("li")
```

  - get the Matrix `li` 

  ```javascript
  let matrix = document.getElementsByTagName("li")[1]
  ```


- `element.getElementsByClassName`
  - get all the `li` elements with the class `movie`

  - returns a collection of elements that match the class name provided

```javascript
document.getElementsByClassName('movie')
```

- `element.querySelector`
  - get the first up-vote `button`

  - return the first element that match the query selector

```javascript
document.querySelector('.up-vote')
```
  
- `element.querySelectorAll`
  - get the all the `up-vote` elements
  
  - returns a node list of items that match the query selector

```javascript
document.querySelectorAll(".up-vote")
```

  - We can also combine selectors for more specificity:
    - We need a space between `#parent .child`
    - We can chain selectors `div.image.highlighted`
    - We can search for siblings with `~`

#### UPDATE:
- replace the welcome image with a different picture

- "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aaqzPMOd_1g/maxresdefault.jpg"

1. get the image from the DOM somehow
2. change the picture being displayed by the img tag

```javascript
let image = document.querySelector("#welcome-image")
image.src = "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aaqzPMOd_1g/maxresdefault.jpg"
```
---

#### DELETE:
- remove the Jaws movie



```javascript

```

---

#### CREATE:
- add a new movie to the DOM

```javascript

```
